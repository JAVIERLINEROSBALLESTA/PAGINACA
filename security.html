    <h2 id="hacker" class="aspect">Difference between active and passive threats</h2>
    <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/hacker.jpg" height="400px" width="500">
    </center>
    <p> Although both active and passive attacks are a part of security attacks, if you compare active and passive attacks, both of them have a lot of differences between them. The main differences between them are made based on how they are done and how much damage they do to the system and its resources. Difference between active and passive attacks in network security are listed down below:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>In active attacks, modification of messages is done, but on the other hand, in passive attacks, the information remains unchanged.
    <li>The active attack causes damage to the integrity and availability of the system, but passive attacks cause damage to data confidentiality. 
    <li>In active attacks, attention is given to detection, while in the other one, attention is given to prevention. 
    <li>The resources can be changed in active attacks, but passive attacks have no impact on the resources.
    <li>The active attack influences the system services, but the information or data is acquired in passive attacks.
    <li>Inactive attacks, information is gathered through passive attacks to attack the system, while passive attacks are achieved by collecting confidential information such as private chats and passwords.
    <li>Active attacks are challenging to be prohibited, but passive attacks are easy to prevent.
    </ul>
    <h2 id="worm" class="aspect">Types of malware</h2>
    <h3> Worm </h3>
  <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/worm.png" height="400px" width="500">
    </center>
    <p> A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behaviour will continue. Computer worms use recursive methods to copy themselves without host programs and distribute themselves based on the law of exponential growth, thus controlling and infecting more and more computers in a short time. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.</p>
    <p> Many worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, as the Morris worm and Mydoom showed, even these "payload-free" worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects. </p>
    <h3>Trojan </h3>
 <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/trojan.png" height="400px" width="500">
    </center>
    <p>In computing, a Trojan horse (or simply trojan) is any malware which misleads users of its true intent. The term is derived from the Ancient Greek story of the deceptive Trojan Horse that led to the fall of the city of Troy.</p>
    <p>Trojans are generally spread by some form of social engineering, for example where a user is duped into executing an email attachment disguised to appear not suspicious, (e.g., a routine form to be filled in), or by clicking on some fake advertisement on social media or anywhere else. Although their payload can be anything, many modern forms act as a backdoor, contacting a controller which can then have unauthorized access to the affected computer. Trojans may allow an attacker to access users' personal information such as banking information, passwords, or personal identity. It can also delete a user's files or infect other devices connected to the network. Ransomware attacks are often carried out using a trojan.</p>
  <p> Unlike computer viruses, worms, and rogue security software, trojans generally do not attempt to inject themselves into other files or otherwise propagate themselves.</p>
  <h3>Virus </h3>e
 <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/virus.jpg" height="400px" width="500">
    </center>
  <p> A computer virus is a type of computer program that, when executed, replicates itself by modifying other computer programs and inserting its own code. If this replication succeeds, the affected areas are then said to be "infected" with a computer virus. </p>
  <p> Computer viruses generally require a host program. The virus writes its own code into the host program. When the program runs, the written virus program is executed first, causing infection and damage. A computer worm does not need a host program, as it is an independent program or code chunk. Therefore, it is not restricted by the host program, but can run independently and actively carry out attacks. </p>
  <p> Computer viruses cause billions of dollars' worth of economic damage each year. </p>
  <h3>Spyware </h3>
 <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/soy.png" height="400px" width="500">
    </center>
  <p> Spyware describes software with malicious behavior that aims to gather information about a person or organization and send such information to another entity in a way that harms the user. For example by violating their privacy or endangering their device's security. This behavior may be present in malware as well as in legitimate software. Websites may engage in spyware behaviors like web tracking. Hardware devices may also be affected. Spyware is frequently associated with advertising and involves many of the same issues. Because these behaviors are so common, and can have non-harmful uses, providing a precise definition of spyware is a difficult task.</p>
    <h2 id="antivirus" class="aspect">Software and hardware to protect networks</h2>
 <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/antivirus.jpg" height="400px" width="500">
    </center>
    <p> Network security combines multiple layers of defenses at the edge and in the network. Each network security layer implements policies and controls. Authorized users gain access to network resources, but malicious actors are blocked from carrying out exploits and threats. Digitization has transformed our world. How we live, work, play, and learn have all changed. Every organization that wants to deliver the services that customers and employees demand must protect its network. Network security also helps you protect proprietary information from attack. Ultimately it protects your reputation. </p>
    <p> There is plenty of network security types, such asfirewalls, email security, antivirus and antimalware software, network segmentation, access control, applicattion security, behavioral analytics, cloud security, data loss preventions, intrusion prevention system, mobile device security, security information and event management, virtual private networks (VPN), web security and wireless security.</p>
    <h2 id="network" class="aspect">Networks protocols</h2>
 <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/network.jpg" height="400px" width="500">
    </center>
    <p> A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world, and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications. </p>
    <p> Similar to the way that speaking the same language simplifies communication between two people, network protocols make it possible for devices to interact with each other because of predetermined rules built into devices’ software and hardware. Neither local area networks (LAN) nor wide area networks (WAN) could function the way they do today without the use of network protocols. </p>
    <h2 id="certificate" class="aspect">Digital certificates and certificate authorities</h2>
 <center
    <img class="left" src="imagenes/certificate.jpg" height="400px" width="500">
<p> Certificate Authorities, or Certificate Authorities / CAs, issue Digital Certificates. Digital Certificates are verifiable small data files that contain identity credentials to help websites, people, and devices represent their authentic online identity (authentic because the CA has verified the identity). CAs play a critical role in how the Internet operates and how transparent, trusted transactions can take place online. CAs issue millions of Digital Certificates each year, and these certificates are used to protect information, encrypt billions of transactions, and enable secure communication. </p>
<p>An SSL Certificate is a popular type of Digital Certificate that binds the ownership details of a web server (and website) to cryptographic keys. These keys are used in the SSL/TLS protocol to activate a secure session between a browser and the web server hosting the SSL Certificate. In order for a browser to trust an SSL Certificate, and establish an SSL/TLS session without security warnings, the SSL Certificate must contain the domain name of website using it, be issued by a trusted CA, and not have expired. </p>
