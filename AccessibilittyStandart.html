     <p> Guidelines on accessible web designWeb Content Accessibility GuidelinesIn 1999 theWeb Accessibility Initiative, a project by theWorld Wide Web Consortium(W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility GuidelinesWCAG 1.0.
  
  <p>On 11 December 2008, the WAI released theWCAG 2.0as a Recommendation. WCAG 2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.WCAG 1.0The WCAG 1.0 was published and became aW3C recommendationon 5 May 1999. They have since been superseded by WCAG 2.0.WCAG 1.0 consists of 14 guidelines—each of which describes a general principle of accessible design. Each guideline covers a basic theme of web accessibility and is associated with one or more checkpoints that describe how to apply that guideline to particular webpage features.Guideline 1: Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual contentGuideline 2: Don’t rely on colour aloneGuideline 3: Use markup and style sheets, and do so properlyGuideline 4: Clarify natural language usageGuideline 5: Create tables that transform gracefullyGuideline 6: Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefullyGuideline 7: Ensure user control of time sensitive content changesGuideline 8: Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfacesGuideline 9: Design for device independenceGuideline 10: User interim solutionsGuideline 11: UseW3Ctechnologies and guidelinesGuideline 12: Provide context and orientation informationGuideline 13: Provide clear navigation mechanismsGuideline 14: Ensure that documents are clear and simpleEach of the in total 65 WCAG 1.0 checkpoints has an assignedpriority levelbased on the checkpoint's impact on accessibility:Priority 1: Web developersmustsatisfy these requirements, otherwise it will be impossible for one or more groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described asA.
Priority 2: Web developersshouldsatisfy these requirements, otherwise some groups will find it difficult to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described asAAorDouble-A.Priority 3: Web developersmaysatisfy these requirements to make it easier for some groups to access the Web content. Conformance to this level is described asAAAorTriple-A.WCAG SamuraiIn February 2008, The WCAG Samurai, a group of developers independent of the W3C, published corrections for, and extensions to, the WCAG 1.0.WCAG 2.0WCAG 2.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on 11 December 2008.It consists oftwelve guidelines (untestable) organized under four principles (websites must beperceivable,operable,understandable, androbust). Each guideline has testable success criteria (61 in all).The W3C's Techniques for WCAG 2.0is a list of techniques that support authors to meet the guidelines and success criteria. The techniques are periodically updated whereas the principles, guidelines and success criteria are stable and do not change.PrinciplesPerceivableInformation and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.Guideline 1.1: Provide text alternatives for any non-text content so that it can be changed into other forms people need, such as large print, braille, speech, symbols or simpler language.Guideline 1.2: Time-based media: Provide alternatives for time-based media.Guideline 1.3: Create content that can be presented in different ways (for example simpler layout) without losing information or structure.Guideline 1.4: Make it easier for users to see and hear content including separatingforeground from background.OperableUser interface components and navigation must be operable.Guideline 2.1: Make all functionality available from a keyboard.Guideline 2.2: Provide users enough time to read and use content.Guideline 2.3: Do not design content in a way that is known to cause seizures.Guideline 2.4: Provide ways to help users navigate, find content, and determine where they are.UnderstandableInformation and the operation of user interface must be understandable.Guideline 3.1: Make text content readable and understandable.Guideline 3.2: Make web pages appear and operate in predictable ways.
Guideline 3.3: Help users avoid and correct mistakes.RobustContent must be robust enough that it can be interpreted reliably by a wide variety of user agents, including assistive technologies.Guideline 4.1.: Maximize compatibility with current and future user agents, includingassistive technologies.WCAG 2.0 uses the same threelevels of conformance(A, AA, AAA) as WCAG 1.0, but hasredefined them. The WCAG working group maintains an extensive list of web accessibility techniques and common failure cases for WCAG 2.0.Criticism of WAI guidelinesThere has been criticism of the W3C process, claiming that it does not sufficiently put the user at the heart of the process. There was a formal objection to WCAG's original claim thatWCAG 2.0 will address requirements for people with learning disabilities and cognitive limitations headed byLisa Seemanand signed by 40 organisations and people.In articles such as "WCAG 2.0: The new W3C guidelines evaluated", "To Hell with WCAG 2.0" and "Testability Costs Too Much",the WAI has been criticised for allowing WCAG 1.0 to get increasingly out of step with today's technologies and techniques for creating and consuming web content, for the slow pace of development of WCAG 2.0, for making the new guidelines difficult to navigate and understand, and other argued failings.In Spain, UNE 139803 is the norm entrusted to regulate web accessibility. This standard is based on Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 1.0.</p>
